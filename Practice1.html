<h1>COMPS READING NOTES</h1>

<h2>Feminist Disability Studies - Kim Q. Hall (2008)</h2>

<h3>"Disability, Sex Radicalism, and Political Agency" - Abby Wilkerson</h3>

<p>The pathologization of certain bodies often has fear at its base -- the fear of frailty, the fear of vulnerability but also, when individual bodies are seen as representative of the larger body politic, disabled/"aberrant" bodies are seen as representing chaos, incoherence, loss of control, etc. (thinking of Garland-Thomson's call for the intellectual tolerance of incoherence which would resist the phallic imperative for unity, legibility, control, etc.).</p>  

<p>Here, Wilkerson talks about the denial of sexuality, the oppression of the sexual agency of the disabled. Drawing from this, Wilkerson wants to make the point that sexual oppression is not just a discrete category of oppression but can be seen to operate across various modalities of oppression, i.e. she calls for a view which sees the common thread running across the oppression of all marginalized identities which often includes the pathologization of their sexuality. Therefore calls for a resistance not just to those forces which deem certain sexualities as perverse but also a resistance to those forces which impel a greater scrutiny of the sexuality of those communities/groups which are variously marginalized. Sexual agency, then, is intimately linked to political agency and social agency. Therefore, the political urgency of a radical politics of sex grounded in the experience of those who are most marginalized.</p> 

<p>For Wilkerson, two spheres of focus: erotophobia (the shame, fear associated with sex and therefore the control and categorization of sexuality) and medical discourse which not just reflects prevailing sociocultural, moral mores but also contributes to and reinforces them (under a supposed garb of truth and objectivity. Latour relevant here to counteract the belief the medicine and biology are totally unrelated to "human" motivations, social scapes and imperatives, etc.).</p> 

<h4>Running notes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Not just that consequences of sexuality are mediated wrt other identity categories but also that to occupy certain identity categories (black, female, poor) is to automatically be “sexually perverted”</li>
<li>Sexual democracy then entails not just opposing those forces which designate certain sexualities as perverse but to oppose all those oppressive social relations and conceptualisation which lead to certain groups’ sexuality being subject to greater scrutiny and control</li> 
<li>Erotophobia: the fear of the erotic which leads to the control and categorisation of pleasures and sexualities (also of components of sexuality); not just unorthodox sexuality but sex itself is a problem never far from the possibility of shame</li>
<li>“Oppressed groups tend to share the experience of being particularly subject to erotophobic judgements…”</li>
